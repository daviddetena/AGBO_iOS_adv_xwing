#X-Wing

### Showing iOS's Core Animation framework


This is a simple project for showing iOS's animations by means of Apple's Core Animation framework.

For this purpose, all we have is the outter space and the starship *X-Wing*.

We can perform two actions:

- With a **tap** we can make the X-Wing move to the point selected in our *space* with a little rotation.
- With a **swipe** we make the X-Wing fade out from its current position and then appear in a random point in our *space*.

The following gif shows perfectly what we can do ;-)
